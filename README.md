# flower-knight
2D sidescroller written in Java with libGDX. Currently, the goal is to produce a functioning demo level in order to internalize OOP concepts learned in courses. This readme will be polished with images (and hopefully a link to a working web demo) when the game is in a more complete state.

Based on Udacity's ["How to Make a Platformer Using libGDX"](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud406) tutorial.
